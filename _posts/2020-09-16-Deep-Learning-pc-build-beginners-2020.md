# Deep Learning PC Build for Beginners in 2020

Hello World !!! 

## What is Deep Learning and Why you must have high compute power

As you might be knowing Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where you deal with complex problems like Image & Text using different Neaural Network Architectures. So, there will be lots of neurons in lots of hidden layers (millions and maybe billions of parameteres) and the job would be to get the optimal weights for these neurons. 

## Cloud vs Local
`Storage` and `Compute` are the two most important things even when doing any kind of Data Analysis. Now you must be wodering about which compute option to choose between cloud or having your own pc. Each option has its own prose and cons. But as a `beginner` I would suggest you to first go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and give it a try. Although it has some limitations on usage but it won't matter if you are a beginner.
And you will get **`free CPU/GPU/TPU`**. Yesssss you read it right !!!


The **`cloud`** option is good in a sense that you don't have to worry about any setup or assembling hardwares. Just spin up some instances and you are good to go. You only have to worry about shutting them down when not in use.

Having a **`local setup`** is what I preferred because I wanted to feel the power at my finger tips, hear the fans running at full speed at extreme loads. Also, my (very)old laptop was broken and I needed something new anyhow.


## How to Select parts for Deep Learning build(or any build)
The two things which determine what parts you should get for your build
  - Budget
  - Purpose of the build

`Budget` could be ranging from $500 to $10,000. It's up to you how much you can afford at the moment.

`Purpose of the build` could be any of the `Deep Learning`, `Gaming`, `Editing` or a combination of them. Where you are going to keep this build? Whether you will be SSHing the build? How often you will be using it?

## My PC parts list
in no particular order

**`1. GPU`**

A Graphical Processing Unit should be the first and one of the most important things to be considered when buiilding a Deep Learning rig. It has many cores to handle the high compute(matrix multiplication). AMD and NVIDIA are the two top brands in race but you might want to go with Nvidia for CUDA and cuDNN. Also, the GPU RAM should be as high as possible to have larger batches to train. When I built my pc, the Nvidia RTX 30XX series GPUs were not launched and there was no point in buying 10XX or 20XX series GPUs(costly but less performing). So I went ahead with the **`Nvidia GTX 1660 SUPER`** for hvaing the best price to perfomance ratio at that time and keeping in mind to upgrade to a 30XX series RTX graphhics card in early 2021.

**`2. CPU`**

**`3. CPU Cooler`**
**`4. Motherboard`**
**`5. RAM`**
**`6. Case`**
**`7. PSU`**
**`8. SSD`**
**`9. Monitor`**
**`10. WebCam`**
**`11. Keyboard`**
**`12. Mouse`**
**`13. Headset`**
**`14. USB Drive`**
